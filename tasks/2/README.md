# Second, Write down tasks
Now, I have the description of the Project, and minimal design to undertand it better.

The next thing I do is divide the Project into smaller parts, that can be easily estimated, and write them down to `tasks.md`.

### How do I split the Project into parts?
There are many ways you can split a project into parts.
I will write an article on that soon.

But here are the main ones, all of them have their pros and cons but 
1. Markup everything with HTML. Do only design but have as many screens look like in design as possible.
2. Go into details of every element and make buttons perfeclty UXy first, then forms, then something else
3. Go by screens. Take screen with pizzas, markup it, do logic for it, move forward.
4. Use user stories. John wants to it pizza, he goes to pizzas list, checks it’s ingredients, adds to the card, orders. That’s how this approach works. You make only those screens that are most required. And then if you have time - do others
