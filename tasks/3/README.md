# Third, Estimate

## How Do I estimate tasks?
1. I take one task, and try to imaging the approximate flow of how I will do it, or use figjam to help me with visualisation.
2. Estimate every step in the task
3. Combine times, and get the time for one task

### Example
Task: "TransactionsList component"

*In my head:*
- Create a component - 10mins
- Add a list of divs, mapping over some mock data - 10mins
- Get data with hooks, probably - 20mins
- ...etc
