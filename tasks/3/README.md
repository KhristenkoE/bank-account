# Third, Estimate

### How I estimate tasks?
I take a single task, then in my head imaging approximate flow of how I will do it, for example task "Make transaction list page"
- Create a component
- Add a list of divs, mapping over mock data
- When I click on a div, I want to open a modal with details of the transaction
...etc

I estimated all of the tasks that are at the time of this commit at ~10-12 hours of work
