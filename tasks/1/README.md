# First, estimate work

I received this task: https://eugenekhristenko.notion.site/Bank-account-task-9861f7a9441d43458c47e75af42b6633

First thing I do is try to understand whether I can do it, and if yes - estimate how much time/money I need to do it.

To me, it's easier to estimate something when it's visualized, that's why the first step is:

### **1. Make a mockup in Figma**

You can look at the screenshots and see how I was moving through the points in the task and tried to undertand them, visualising the process.

The goal here is to do it as quickly as possible to understand whether it worths spending any more of my time.

In my case, I came to the final realization in 20 minutes, which is pertty good, I assume.
